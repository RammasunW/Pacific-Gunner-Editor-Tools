Tools for modifying Pacific Gunner.

WIP, so far 2 tools are available.

Map mixing tool:
Mixes the height files (.map format) of two maps to generate one map that includes highest points from both maps.

Coordinates tool:
Categorizes and visualizes coordinates from move.dat, the file that stores all coordinates of in-game objects and entities. Coord colors correspond to in-game radar colors (green dots are for map objects).
